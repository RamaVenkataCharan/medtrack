## 📌 Executive Summary

**MedTrack** is a specialized digital khata (ledger) management system designed for retail pharmacy counter speed. It replaces physical paper credit books with sub-2-second customer phone lookups, provides strict mathematical due derivations, and operates with zero cloud lock-in.

The ecosystem comprises three decoupled, standalone components:
1. **Web Frontend (`/client`)**: Countertop React 18 application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
2. **Backend API (`/server`)**: Local Node.js + Express REST API backed by an atomic, WAL-mode SQLite database with automated backup and PDF receipt engines for countertop operations.
3. **Mobile App (`/mobile`)**: **100% Offline-First & Standalone** Android application built with React Native (Expo) and `expo-sqlite`. Operates with **zero network communication or data synchronization** to the web/backend system. All data resides exclusively in local on-device SQLite. Disaster recovery is achieved via manual JSON backup exports.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Test Report

The core business logic and ledger integrity are verified by an automated regression test suite (`server/tests/core_tests.js`).

**Latest Execution Results:**
```
====================================================
  Running MedTrack Core Scope Tests
  Target: Customer & Medicine Search (Khata only)
====================================================

━━━ 1. Customer Registration & Phone Search ━━━
  ✅ Customer lookup by exact phone number succeeds
  ✅ Customer details match name
  ✅ Customer village matches
  ✅ Partial phone number search matches debtor
  ✅ New customer starts with exactly 0.00 due

━━━ 2. Visit Purchase Entry & Dynamic Line Items ━━━
  ✅ Purchase entry saved successfully
  ✅ Entry due_amount accurately computed as total - paid (450 - 150 = 300)
  ✅ Customer total due reflects first purchase balance
  ✅ All 3 medicine line items saved in entry_medicine
  ✅ Line item medicine name correct
  ✅ Second entry due amount is ₹300
  ✅ Cumulative customer due is ₹600 (300 + 300)

━━━ 3. Payment Recording & Live Balance Reduction ━━━
  ✅ Payment recorded successfully
  ✅ Previous due was ₹600
  ✅ Remaining due correctly reduced to ₹200 (600 - 400)
  ✅ Live customer due strictly derives as ₹200
  ✅ Customer due clears completely to ₹0 ("All Clear")
  ✅ Derived due is zero

━━━ 4. Medicine Autocomplete Suggestions ━━━
  ✅ Autocomplete matches "Paracetamol 500mg" from past entries
  ✅ Autocomplete matches "Vitamin C Chewable"
  ✅ Empty autocomplete query returns recent distinct medicines

━━━ 5. Customer Stats & Frequency Analysis ━━━
  ✅ Customer total visits count is 2
  ✅ Customer total spent is ₹750 (450 + 300)
  ✅ Customer total due is ₹0
  ✅ Recently bought list is populated
  ✅ Paracetamol appears in recently bought
  ✅ Paracetamol frequency is 2 (bought in 2 visits)

━━━ 6. Ledger Accounting Guardrails ━━━
  ✅ Rejects entry with non-positive total amount
  ✅ Rejects purchase entry where amount paid > total purchase amount
  ✅ Rejects purchase entry with no medicine line items

━━━ 7. Data Safety: Backup Integrity, Restore & Export ━━━
  ✅ Manual/forced backup returns success
  ✅ Backup file physically created on disk
  ✅ Backup file verified as valid, openable SQLite database
  ✅ listBackups returns existing backups array
  ✅ Newly created backup appears in backup list
  ✅ restoreBackup succeeds using valid backup file
  ✅ generateCsvExport generates non-empty string
  ✅ CSV contains customer ledger header
  ✅ CSV contains existing customer data

====================================================
  Tests Passed: 39 / 39 (100%)
  Tests Failed: 0

## 🗄️ Database Schema & Invariants

```sql
-- Customers Master
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  phone_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  village TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Purchase Visits
CREATE TABLE entries (
  entry_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  entry_date TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  total_amount REAL NOT NULL,
  amount_paid REAL NOT NULL,
  due_amount REAL NOT NULL
);

-- Medicines Per Purchase Visit
CREATE TABLE entry_medicine (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  entry_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES entries(entry_id),
  medicine_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

-- Debt Settlements & Payments
CREATE TABLE payments (
  payment_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  pay_date TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  note TEXT
);

-- Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_phone ON customers(phone_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_entries_customer ON entries(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_customer ON payments(customer_id);
```

**Non-Negotiable Invariants:**
1. **Mathematical Ledger Rule:**
   $$\text{Customer Outstanding Due} = \sum (\text{entries.due\_amount}) - \sum (\text{payments.amount})$$
2. **Atomicity Rule:** An entry and its child medicine rows must commit within the same database transaction.
3. **No Phantom Dues:** `due_amount` is always `total_amount - amount_paid` at the time of visit.
